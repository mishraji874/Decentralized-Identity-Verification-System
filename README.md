# Decentralized Identity Verification System

A Decentralized Identity Verification System Smart Contract is a blockchain-based protocol designed to manage and authenticate digital identities in a decentralized manner. It allows individuals or entities to prove their identity without relying on a centralized authority, such as a government or a third-party service provider.

Decentralized identity is an approach to identify and authenticate users and entities without a centralized authority.

Identity management uses attributes such as name, birth date, Social Security number or email address to verify a person or entity to interact and transact with an online service. A digital identity is an online persona and representation of a person acting online.

## How does decentralized identity work?

Decentralized identity systems rely on public key infrastructure (PKI) cryptography to secure and manage identity. With PKI, there is a public key and a private key to encrypt data. All transactions in the blockchain are immutable so they cannot be tampered with and are distributed to all nodes in the distributed ledger.

With blockchain, there is an entry that represents a user identity. That is where the concept of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) comes into play. With all forms of identity, there is a need for identifiers — pieces of information about a given entity, such as a name or date of birth. Decentralized identifiers are different, as they are not issued by a central authority. Decentralized identifiers are controlled by individuals.

#### KEY FEATURES AND COMPONENTS OF A DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM SMART CONTRACT

1. User Registration: Users can register their identity on the blockchain by providing necessary information. This information could include personal details, biometrics, or cryptographic keys.
2. Identity Verification Process: The contract may implement various identity verification methods, such as multi-factor authentication, cryptographic signatures, oracles, and potentially other mechanisms. This process ensures that the provided identity information is valid.
3. Identity Attestation: Third-party entities or authorities can attest to the validity of a user’s identity. These attestations are stored on the blockchain and can be used as proof of identity.
4. Privacy and Security Measures: The smart contract should incorporate robust encryption and privacy-preserving techniques to protect sensitive user information.
5. Revocation and Recovery: There should be a mechanism for revoking or recovering a user’s identity in case of loss, theft, or other emergencies.
6. Access Control: The contract may include features for managing permissions and access rights, allowing users to control who can access their verified identity information.
7. Interoperability: The smart contract should be designed to work with other identity management systems or standards to ensure compatibility and ease of integration with existing services.
8. Events and Logs: These are crucial for maintaining a transparent and auditable record of all identity-related activities on the blockchain.
9. Governance Mechanism: Depending on the use case, there may be a need for a governance mechanism that allows participants to collectively make decisions about the operation and rules of the identity verification system.
10. User Interface (Optional): While not a part of the smart contract itself, a user interface (UI) can be developed to provide a user-friendly way for individuals to interact with the identity verification system.

#### USECASES OF A DECENTRALIZED IDENTITY VERIFICATION SMART CONTRACT.

1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): In DeFi platforms, users need to verify their identities to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. A decentralized identity verification system can streamline this process, ensuring compliance while maintaining user privacy.
2. Government Services: Government agencies can use decentralized identity verification to issue and manage digital IDs for citizens. This can include passports, driver’s licenses, and other official documents, allowing for secure and tamper-proof identification.
3. Healthcare: A decentralized identity verification system can be utilized to securely manage patient records and grant access to medical professionals while maintaining patient confidentiality. It can also be used for verifying the credentials of healthcare professionals.
4. Education and Credentials: Educational institutions can issue and verify academic credentials on the blockchain. This would enable employers and other institutions to easily verify a person’s educational qualifications without relying on centralized authorities.
5. Online Marketplaces: E-commerce platforms can implement decentralized identity verification to build trust between buyers and sellers. It can help verify the identities of sellers, ensuring a safer and more transparent transaction process.
6. Supply Chain and Logistics: Decentralized identity verification can be used to authenticate various stakeholders in a supply chain, such as manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. This ensures that products are sourced and delivered from legitimate sources.
7. Real Estate: Property transactions often require identity verification. A decentralized system can streamline the process, allowing for secure property purchases, rentals, and leases.
8. Social Media and Content Platforms: Decentralized identity verification can help combat issues like fake accounts and identity theft on social media platforms. Users can have verified profiles, enhancing trust within the community.
9. Access Control and Security: Companies can use decentralized identity verification for granting access to secure facilities or digital resources. It adds an extra layer of security, as access is tied to verified identities.
10. Voting Systems: Decentralized identity verification can be employed in electronic voting systems to ensure that only eligible voters cast their ballots. It can help prevent voter fraud and enhance the integrity of the electoral process.
11. Travel and Immigration: Airports and immigration authorities can use decentralized identity verification for passport control, visa issuance, and other travel-related processes.
12. Legal and Notary Services: Law firms and notaries can utilize decentralized identity verification to authenticate the identities of clients and witnesses in legal transactions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the decentralized token exchange smart contract:

1.  Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mishraji874/Decentralized-Identity-Verification-System.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd decentralized-identity-verification-system
```

### Foundry Commands:

Here are the Foundry commands for compiling, deploying, interacting with, and testing the smart contracts:

1. Initialize Foundry:

```bash
forge init
```

2. Install dependenices:

```bash
forge install
```

3. Compile smart contracts:

```bash
forge compile
```

4. Test Contracts:

```bash
forge test
```

5. Make the ```.env``` file and add your SEPOLIA_RPC_URL, PRIVATE_KEY and your ETHERSCAN_API_KEY for verification of the deployed contract.

6. Deploy Smart Contract:

    If deploying to the test network run the following command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployIdentityVerification.s.sol
    ```

    If deploying to the Sepolia test network run the following command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployIdentityVerification.s.sol --rpc-url ${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY}
    ```

    And, for verification from the Etherscan about the deployed contract run the following command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployIdentityVerification.s.sol --rpc-url ${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY} --verify ${ETHERSCAN_API_KEY} --broadcast
    ```
